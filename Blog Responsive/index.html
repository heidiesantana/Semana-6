					<h2>Artist Nathan Sawaya talks Super Heroes</h2>

					<h2>Sawaya couldn't get museums to take him seriously</h2>
						<p>"I'd been reaching out to art galleries who were not really getting what I did," Sawaya said. "At the time, when I brought up the idea of Lego art, people pictured cars and trucks and little castles — things they saw at the toy store. People didn't see it as an art medium."</p>
